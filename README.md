The repository contains the code in .ipynb and the dataset used in the research to develop the Political Fake News Detection System of the combination of BERT embedding and XGBoost Classifier. 

Abstractâ€”The rapid growth of technology has increased the speed of information spread, especially due to the abundance of available sources, such as social media. However, the increasing speed of information spread brings consequences such as the spread of fake news when used irresponsibly. In politics, fake news could cause public distrust of the government, social and political instability, and even disintegration. This research aims to develop a political fake news detection model with a proposed model of BERT embedding combined with XGBoost Classifier to address the problem. Furthermore, this research also determined to identify patterns differentiating real news from fake news. As this research is a binary classification problem, the proposed model was evaluated on accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score, supported with a Confusion Matrix. Evaluation results indicated a satisfactory performance of the proposed model with a 96.88% accuracy score and a low risk of overfitting and misclassification. The pattern analysis was conducted with an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) which resulted in the findings that real news uses more contextually relevant words compared to fake news, which uses more clickbait words and videos to increase engagement. The research findings has the potential to be applicable to solve the political fake news detection problem to reduce the impacts caused by political fake news.
